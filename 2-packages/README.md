- Install the community-made package called `color` by running `npm install --save color`.
- Open `package.json` to see how `--save` automatically added `color` in  `dependencies`.
- A `node_modules` folder has also been created to store the package.
- Add `const Color = require('color');` in `index.js`
- Use the package like this for instance: `const redHexa = Color({r: 255, g: 0, b: 0}).hexString();`
- Print `redHexa`, it should show `#FF0000`
