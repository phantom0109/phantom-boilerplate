# Modern JavaScript Stack Training

Welcome to my modern JavaScript stack tutorial. This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide to building a modern Front-End stack, with some bits of Back-End as well. The goal is to take you from **zero** to knowing how to setup **ES6, Babel, Gulp, ESLint, React, Webpack**. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics.

A lot of React tutorials completely skip the setup part, which makes newcomers build their learning on weak foundations. Instead of giving beginners a "black box" configuration, the approach I'm taking here is to teach the foundations in the simplest possible way, so you understand what happens in the entire stack of tools.

Code examples are available for each section, and you can run them all with `npm start` (see [section 1](/1-npm-and-package-json)). I recommending writing everything from scratch yourself for a better understanding.
