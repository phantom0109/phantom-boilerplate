Welcome to my modern JavaScript stack tutorial: **JavaScript Stack from Scratch**.

This is a minimalistic and straight to the point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. The goal is to take you from zero to knowing how to set up **ES6, Babel, Gulp, ESLint, React, Redux, Webpack, Immutable, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Flow**. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. **It focuses on wiring all these tools together** and giving you the **simplest possible context** for each tool. You can see this tutorial as *a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch*.

Since the goal of this tutorial is to assemble various tools, I do not go into details about how these tools work individually. Refer to their documentation or find other tutorials if you want to acquire deeper knowledge in some of them.

A big chunk of the stack described in this tutorial uses React. A lot of React tutorials completely skip the setup part, which makes newcomers build their learning on weak foundations. Instead of giving beginners a "black box" configuration, the approach I'm taking here is to teach the foundations in the simplest possible way, so you understand what happens in the entire stack of tools.

Code examples are available for each section, and you can run them all with `npm install && npm start` (see section 1). I recommend writing everything from scratch yourself for a better understanding.
