# 04 - Webpack, React, and Hot Module Replacement

## Webpack

> üí° **[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)** is a *module bundler*. It takes a whole bunch of various source files, processes them, and assembles them into one (usually) JavaScript file called a bundle, which is the only file your client will execute.

Let's create some very basic *hello world* and bundle it with Webpack.

- Create an `src/client/index.js` file containing:

```js
import 'babel-polyfill'

document.querySelector('.js-app').innerHTML = '<h1>Hello Webpack!</h1>'
```

If you want to use some of the most recent ES features in your client code, like `Promise`s, you need to include the [Babel Polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) before anything else in in your bundle.

- Run `yarn add babel-polyfill`.

If you run ESLint on this file, it will complain about `document` being undefined.

- Add the following to your `.eslintrc.json` at the root of the object to allow the use of `window` and `document`:

```json
"env": {
  "browser": true
}
```

Alright, we now need to bundle this ES6 client app into an ES5 bundle. It's going to take quite a few changes to get there, so bear with me until the end.

- In `src/shared/config`, add the following constant:

```js
export const WDS_PORT = 7000
```

- Create a `webpack.config.babel.js` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import path from 'path'

import { WDS_PORT } from './src/shared/config'
import { isProd } from './src/shared/util'

export default {
  entry: [
    './src/client',
  ],
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/js'),
    publicPath: `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist/js/`,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, use: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ },
    ],
  },
  devtool: isProd ? false : 'source-map',
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
  },
  devServer: {
    port: WDS_PORT,
  },
}
```

This file is used to describe how our bundle should be assembled: `entry` is the starting point of our app and `output.filename` is the file path of the bundle to generate. We put it in a `dist` folder, which will contain bundles and other things that are generated automatically (unlike the declarative CSS we created earlier which lives in `public`). `module.rules` is where you tell Webpack to apply some treatment to some type of files. Here we say that we want all `.js` and `.jsx` (for React) files except the ones in `node_modules` to go through something called `babel-loader`. We also want these two extensions to `resolve`. Finally, we declare a port for Webpack Dev Server.

**Note**: The `.babel.js` extension is a Webpack feature to apply our Babel transformations to this config file.

`babel-loader` is a plugin for Webpack that transpiles your code just like we've been doing since the beginning of this tutorial. The only difference is that this time, the code will end up running in the browser of your client instead of your server.

- Run `yarn add --dev webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader`.

`babel-core` is a peer-dependency of `babel-loader`, so we installed it as well.

- Add `/dist/` to your `.gitignore`.

### Development / Production variations

In development mode, we are going to use `webpack-dev-server` to take advantage of hot module reloading, and in production we'll simply use `webpack` to generate bundles. In both cases, the `--progress` flag is useful to display additional information when Webpack is compiling your files. In production, we'll also pass the `-p` flag to `webpack` to minify our code, and the `NODE_ENV` variable set to `production`.

Create a `dev:wds` and tweak your `prod:build` task:

```json
"dev:wds": "webpack-dev-server --progress",
"prod:build": "rimraf lib dist && babel src -d lib --ignore test.js && cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --progress",
```

- Next, let's create a `<div class="js-app"></div>` container in our `src/server/render-app.js`, and include the bundle that will be generated:

```js
// @flow

import { STATIC_PATH, WDS_PORT } from '../shared/config'
import { isProd } from '../shared/util'

const renderApp = (title: string) =>
`<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>${title}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="${STATIC_PATH}/css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="js-app"></div>
    <script src="${isProd ? STATIC_PATH : `http://localhost:${WDS_PORT}/dist`}/js/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
`

export default renderApp
```

Depending on the environment we're in, we'll include either the Webpack Dev Server bundle, or the production bundle. Note that the path to Webpack Dev Server's bundle is *virtual*, `dist/js/bundle.js` is not actually read from your hard drive in development mode. It's also necessary to give Webpack Dev Server a different port than your main web port.

Finally, in `src/server/index.js`, tweak your `console.log` message like so:

```js
console.log(`Server running on port ${WEB_PORT} ${isProd ? '(production)' :
  '(development).\nKeep "yarn dev:wds" running in an other terminal'}.`)
```

That will give other developers a hint about what to do if they try to just run `yarn start` without Webpack Dev Server.

Alright that was a lot of changes, let's see if everything works as expected:

üèÅ Run `yarn start`. Once Webpack Dev Server is done generating the bundle and its sourcemaps (which should both be ~600kB files) and the process hangs in your terminal, open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should see "Hello Webpack!". Open your Chrome console, and under the Source tab, check which files are included. You should only see `static/css/style.css` under `localhost:8000/`, and have all your ES6 source files under `webpack://./src`. That means sourcemaps are working. In your editor, in `src/client/index.js`, try changing `Hello Webpack!` into any other string. As you save the file, Webpack Dev Server in your terminal should generate a new bundle and the Chrome tab should reload automatically. You can interrupt the process with Ctrl+C.

- Run `yarn prod`. Once Webpack is done generating the minified bundle (~90kB this time), open `http://localhost:8000/` and you should still see "Hello Webpack!". In the Source tab of the Chrome console, you should this time find `static/js/bundle.js` under `localhost:8000/`, but no `webpack://` sources. Click on `bundle.js` to make sure it is minified.

Good job, I know this was quite dense. You deserve a break! The next section is easier.

## React

> üí° **[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)** is a library for building user interfaces by Facebook. It uses the **[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)** syntax to represent HTML elements and components while leveraging the power of JavaScript.

In this section we are going to render some text using React and JSX.

First, let's install React and ReactDOM:

- Run `yarn add react react-dom`.

Rename your `src/client/index.js` file into `src/client/index.jsx` and write some React code in it:

```js
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello React!</h1>, document.querySelector('.app'))
```

Since we use the JSX syntax here, we have to tell Babel that it needs to transform it as well.

- Run `yarn add --dev babel-preset-react` and add `react` to your `.babelrc` file like so:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "latest",
    "flow",
    "react"
  ]
}
```

üèÅ Run `yarn start` (or `yarn prod`) and open Chrome on `http://localhost:8000`. You should see "Hello React!".

Now try changing the text in `src/client/index.jsx` to something else. Webpack Dev Server should reload the page automatically, which is pretty neat, but we are going to make it even better.

## Hot Module Replacement

> üí° **[Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)** (*HMR*) is a powerful Webpack feature to replace a module on the fly without reloading the entire page.

To make HMR work with React, we are going to need to tweak a few things.

- Run `yarn add --dev react-hot-loader@next`

- Edit your `webpack.config.babel.js` like so:

```js
import webpack from 'webpack'
// [...]
entry: [
  'react-hot-loader/patch',
  './src/client',
],
// [...]
devServer: {
  port: WDS_PORT,
  hot: true,
},
plugins: [
  new webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin(),
  new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
  new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin(),
  new webpack.NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin(),
],
```

- Create a `src/client/app.jsx` file containing:

```js
// @flow

import React from 'react'

const App = () => (
  <h1>Hello React with HMR!</h1>
)

export default App
```

And finally edit your `src/client/index.jsx` file:

```js
// @flow

/* eslint-disable import/no-extraneous-dependencies */

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader'

import App from './app'

const rootEl = document.querySelector('.js-app')

const wrapApp = AppComponent =>
  <AppContainer>
    <AppComponent />
  </AppContainer>

ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(App), rootEl)

if (module.hot) {
  // flow-disable-next-line
  module.hot.accept('./app', () => {
    /* eslint-disable global-require */
    const NextApp = require('./app').default
    /* eslint-enable global-require */
    ReactDOM.render(wrapApp(NextApp), rootEl)
  })
}
```

Please ignore the Flow and ESLint comments to focus on what we're doing here: We need to make our `App` a child of `react-hot-loader`'s `AppContainer`, and we need to `require` the next version of our `App` when hot-reloading. To make this  process clean and DRY, we create a little `wrapApp` function that we use in both places it needs to render `App`. Feel free to move the `eslint-disable global-require` to the top of the file to make this more readable.

üèÅ Restart your `yarn dev:wds` process if it was still running. Open `localhost:8000`. In the Console tab, you should see some logs about HMR. Go ahead and change something in `src/client/app.jsx` and your changes should be reflected in your browser after a few seconds, without any full-page reload!
