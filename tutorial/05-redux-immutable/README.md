# 05 - Redux and Immutable

In this chapter we will hook up React and Redux to make a very simple app. The app will consist of a message and a button. The message changes when the user clicks the button.

Before we start, here is a very quick introduction to ImmutableJS, which is completely unrelated to React and Redux, but will be used in this chapter.

## ImmutableJS

> ðŸ’¡ **[ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)** (or just Immutable) is a library by Facebook to manipulate immutable collections, like lists and maps. Any change made on an immutable object returns a new object without mutating the original object.

For instance, instead of doing:

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1 }
obj.a = 2 // Mutates `obj`
```

You would do:

```javascript
const obj = Immutable.Map({ a: 1 })
obj.set('a', 2) // Returns a new object without mutating `obj`
```

This approach follows the **functional programming** paradigm, which works really well with Redux.

When creating immutable collections, a very convenient method is `Immutable.fromJS()`, which takes any regular JS object or array and returns a deeply immutable version of it:

```javascript
const immutablePerson = Immutable.fromJS({
  name: 'Stan',
  friends: ['Kyle', 'Cartman', 'Kenny'],
})

console.log(immutablePerson)

/*
 * Map {
 *   "name": "Stan",
 *   "friends": List [ "Kyle", "Cartman", "Kenny" ]
 * }
 */
```

- Run `yarn add immutable`.

**Note**: Due to the implementation of ImmutableJS, Flow does not accept importing it with `import Immutable from 'immutable'`, so use this syntax instead: `import * as Immutable from 'immutable'`. Let's cross fingers for a [fix](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/863) soon.

## Redux

> ðŸ’¡ **[Redux](http://redux.js.org/)** is a library to handle the lifecycle of your application. It creates a *store*, which is the single source of truth of the state of your app at any given time.

Let's start with the easy part, declaring our Redux actions:

- Run `yarn add redux redux-actions`.

- Create a `src/client/action/dog.js` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import { createAction } from 'redux-actions'

export const BARK = 'BARK'
export const bark = createAction(BARK)
```

This file exposes an *action*, `BARK`, and its *action creator*, `bark`, which is a function. We use [`redux-actions`](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions) to reduce the boilerplate associated with Redux actions. `redux-actions` implement the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) model, which makes *action creators* return objects with the `type` and `payload` attributes.

- Create a `src/client/reducer/dog.js` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import * as Immutable from 'immutable'

import { BARK } from '../action/dog'

const initialState = Immutable.fromJS({
  barkMessage: 'The dog is quiet',
})

const dogReducer = (state: Object = initialState, action: { type: string, payload: any }) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case BARK:
      return state.set('barkMessage', action.payload)
    default:
      return state
  }
}

export default dogReducer
```

In this file we initialize the state of our reducer with an Immutable Map containing one property, `barkMessage`, set to `The dog is quiet`. The `dogReducer` handles `BARK` actions by simply setting the new `barkMessage` with the action payload. The Flow annotation for `action` destructures it into a `type` and a `payload`. The `payload` can be of `any` type. It looks funky if you've never seen this before, but it remains pretty understandable. Note the usage of `Immutable.fromJS()` and `set()` as seen before.

## React-Redux

> ðŸ’¡ **[react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)** *connects* a Redux store with React components. With `react-redux`, when the Redux store changes, React components get automatically updated. They can also fire Redux actions.

- Run `yarn add react-redux`.

In this section we are going to create *Components* and *Containers*.

**Components** are *dumb* React components, in a sense that they don't know anything about the Redux state. **Containers** are *smart* components that know about the state and that we are going to *connect* to our dumb components.

- Create a `src/client/component/bark-button.jsx` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'

const BarkButton = ({ bark }: { bark: Function }) =>
  <button onClick={bark}>Bark</button>

BarkButton.propTypes = {
  bark: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
}

export default BarkButton
```

**Note**: You can see another case of destructuring with Flow annotations here. If `props` contains `bark`, instead of writing `const BarkButton = (props) => { props.bark() }`, we write `const BarkButton = ({ bark }: { bark: Function }) => { bark() }`. The syntax is a bit cumbersome but worth it.

- Create a `src/client/component/message.jsx` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'

const Message = ({ message }: { message: string }) =>
  <div>{message}</div>

Message.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
}

export default Message
```

These are examples of *dumb* components. They are logic-less, and just show whatever they are asked to show via React **props**. The main difference between `bark-button.jsx` and `message.jsx` is that `BarkButton` contains an reference to an action dispatcher in its props, where `Message` contains some data to show.

Again, *components* don't know anything about Redux **actions** or the **state** of our app, which is why we are going to create smart **containers** that will feed the proper action dispatchers and data to these 2 dumb components.

- Create a `src/client/container/bark-button.js` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import { connect } from 'react-redux'

import { bark } from '../action/dog'
import BarkButton from '../component/bark-button'

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  bark: () => { dispatch(bark('Wah wah!')) },
})

export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(BarkButton)
```

This container hooks up the `BarkButton` component with the `bark` action and Redux's `dispatch` method.

- Create a `src/client/container/message.js` file containing:

```javascript
// @flow

import { connect } from 'react-redux'

import Message from '../component/message'

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  message: state.dog.get('barkMessage'),
})

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Message)
```

This container hooks up the Redux's app state with the `Message` component. When the state changes, `Message` will now automatically re-render with the proper `message` prop. These connections are done via the `connect` function of `react-redux`.

We still haven't initialized the Redux store and haven't put the 2 containers anywhere in our app yet:

- Edit `entry.jsx` like so:

```javascript
// @flow

import 'babel-polyfill'

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'

import BarkButton from './container/bark-button'
import Message from './container/message'
import dogReducer from './reducer/dog'

/* eslint-disable no-underscore-dangle */
const store = createStore(combineReducers({
  dog: dogReducer,
}), window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__())
/* eslint-enable no-underscore-dangle */

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div>
      <Message />
      <BarkButton />
    </div>
  </Provider>
  , document.querySelector('.js-app'))
```

Let's take a moment to review this. First, we create a *store* with `createStore`. Stores are created by passing reducers to them. Here we only have one reducer, but for the sake of future scalability, we use `combineReducers` to group all of our reducers together. The last weird parameter of `createStore` is something to hook up Redux to browser [Devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), which are incredibly useful when debugging. Since ESLint will complain about the underscores in `__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__`, we surround that block with comments to temporarily disable this ESLint rule.

Next, we wrap our entire app inside `react-redux`'s `Provider` component and pass it our store. We put our 2 **containers** in a `<div>` because `Provider` must have a single child.

- You can now run `yarn start` and open `http://localhost:8000`. You should see "The dog is quiet" and a button. When you click the button, the message should change to "Wah wah!". If you installed the Redux Devtools in your browser, you should see the app state change over time as you click on the button.

Congratulations, we finally made an app that does something! Okay it's not a *super* impressive from the outside, but we all know that it is powered by one badass stack under the hood.
