# How to translate this tutorial

Thank you for your interest in translating my tutorial! Here are a few recommendations to get started.

This tutorial is in constant evolution to provide the best learning experience to readers. Both the code and the `README.md` files will change over time. It is great if you do a one-shot translation that won't evolve, but it would be even better if you could try to keep up with the original English version as it changes!

Here is what I think is a good workflow:

- Fork the main [English repository](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch).

- Translate the `README.md` files.

- Add a note somewhere explaining on the main `README.md` that this is a translation, with a link to the English repository.

- Submit a Pull Request to the English repo to add a link to your forked repository under the Translations section of the main `README.md`. It could look like this:

```md
## Translations

- [Language name](#) by [@yourgithubusername](http://yourwebsite.com)
or
- [Language name](#) by [@yourgithubusername](http://twitter.com/yourprofile)
or
- [Language name](#) by [@yourgithubusername](http://github.com/yourprofile)
```

Since I want to reward you for your good work as much as possible, you can put any link you like on your Github username (to your personal website, Twitter profile, or Github profile for instance).

- After your original one-shot translation, if you want to update your repo with the latest change from the main English repo, [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with my repo. To make it easy to see what changed since your initial translation, you can use Github's feature to [compare commits](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/#comparing-commits). Set the **base** to the last commit from the English repo you used to translate, and compare it to **master**, like so:

https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/compare/dfab78b581a3da800daeb3686b900dd9ea972da0...master

That should give you a easy-to-read diff to see exactly what changed since your translation!
