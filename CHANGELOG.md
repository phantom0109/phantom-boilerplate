# Change Log

## 2.0.0 (2016-xx-xx)

- Combined some chapters to make it easier to maintain the tutorial.
- Added Express chapter instead of `dist/index.html`.
- Mocha is now compiled on the fly by Babel instead of relying on the `lib` build.
- Removed Gulp entirely to replace it by NPM/Yarn scripts (I got convinced by this [awesome article](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/webpack-browserify-gulp-which-is-better#webpack--npm-scripts-setup)).
